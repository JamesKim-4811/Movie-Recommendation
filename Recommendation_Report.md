#### **Title: Movie Recommendation System Report**

#### **1. Introduction**
- Briefly introduce **movie recommendation systems** and why they are important.
- Explain the **different approaches used** (user-based, item-based, random-walk).

#### **2. Dataset Description**
- Describe the **MovieLens 100K dataset**:
  - Number of users, movies, and ratings.
  - What features were used.
  - Any preprocessing performed.

#### **3. Methodology**
- Explain the three recommendation techniques implemented:
  - **User-based collaborative filtering** (how user similarity was calculated).
  - **Item-based collaborative filtering** (how item similarity was determined).
  - **Random-walk-based Pixie algorithm** (why graph-based approaches are effective).
  
#### **4. Implementation Details**
- Discuss the steps taken to build the functions.
- Describe how the **adjacency list graph** was created.
- Explain how **random walks** were performed and how visited movies were ranked.

#### **5. Results and Evaluation**
- Present **example outputs** from each recommendation approach.
- Compare the different methods in terms of accuracy and usefulness.
- Discuss any **limitations** in the implementation.

#### **6. Conclusion**
- Summarize the key takeaways from the project.
- Discuss potential improvements (e.g., **hybrid models, additional features**).
- Suggest real-world applications of the methods used.
